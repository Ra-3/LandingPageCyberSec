# Coding Along with Adrian (JavaScript Mastery)

Welcome to my coding journey! In this repository, I am following along with Adrian from [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukiGFmZ32YA&t=336s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery). As an aspiring software developer, I'm using this project to learn best practices and improve my skills.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is based on a tutorial where Adrian guides viewers through the development of a modern SaaS app landing page using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. While I am not the original developer of this application, I am documenting my progress and any challenges I face while coding along with him.
